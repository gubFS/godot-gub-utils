*DISCLAIMER: These utilities are made by me and their intended use is in my other projects. So there is no guarantee of backward compatibility, or necessarily any logic or reason to why things are added or changed. Some classes might also be filled only halfway with features, as I only add what I need. With that in mind, feel free to copy or use anything here if you'd like though :)*

This repository contains some utility classes and nodes that I find useful. Notable ones:

> ## Observable properties
> Properties that emit a signal when changed. Ability to bind it with other properties.

> ## Extended GDScript
> Classes prefixed with 'Gub', that extend the functionality of built-in types.

> ## C# classes
> Classes that mimic features from C#, such as Task and LINQ expressions.

> ## Data types
> Common data types implemented in GDScript, including: Queues, Sets, and BitFlags.

This is just a small overview, please check the source for more detailed info if you are interested.
